# Secret-santa
Kotlin program to randomly assign your group's santas.
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa), "secret santa" is
> [...] a Western Christmas tradition in which members of a group or community are randomly assigned a person to whom they give a gift. The identity of the gift giver is to remain a secret and should not be revealed.

Sounds fun? This program will help you with that. Simply clone the repo and run
```
kotlinc secretsanta.kt && Kotlin SecretsantaKt
```
<br/>

Now input the names of your group members in the terminal (e.g. sergey birk david ole). This will write four new files, a file for each name, containing a different name. Send the files to the right people and delete them from your computer without looking. Have fun!
